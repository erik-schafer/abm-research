> The approach provides a rst step towards modelling contagion risk when true linkages are unknown. It would be useful to extend the simulation analysis by relaxing the assumption that the defaulting bank is randomly selected and, along the lines of Albert et al (2000), considering the implications of targeted failure affecting big or highly connected interbank borrowers. This would be particularly interesting in a set-up in which the joint degree distribution was calibrated to match observed data. Added realism could also be incorporated into the model by using real balance sheets for each bank or endogenising the formation of the network. Extending the model in this direction could help guide the empirical modelling of contagion risk and is left for future work.

> Our starting point has been a detailed analysis of the LM
model first in terms of the role played by the total number
of players N and also on the study of the stability of the
SF with respect to the variation of the other parameters.
A particular puzzling point was the fact that the SF are
present only for a finite value of N (N = 500) in the LM
model and not in the asymptotic limit N → ∞. Starting from this consideration our aim has been to introduce
a minimal ABM based on fundamentalists and chartists
which would permit to clarify these points and eventually also to discuss the self-organization. A basic technical
simplification is the description of the chartists in terms of
the newly introduced effective potential model. This and
other similar simplifications permit us to analyze in detail the mathematical properties of the model. In order
to achieve the deepest understanding of the dynamics we
have focused for the moment on the linear returns. In paper II [13], we are going to consider also the extension to
logarithmic returns but in the limit of small fluctuations
the two approach essentially coincide. The main results of
our model are:
– detailed understanding of the origin of the SF with
respect to the microscopic dynamics of the agents;
– demonstration that in this class of model the SF correspond to finite size effects and not to universal critical
exponents. This finite size effect, however, can be active at different time scales;
bubbles of chartists can be triggered spontaneously
by a multiplicative cascade which can originate from
tiny random fluctuations. This situation resembles in
part the avalanches of the sandpile model in statistical
physics [32];
– we have shown the importance of the non stationarity in the dynamics of the number of active agents N
and we introduced a characteristic threshold to decide
when an agent can enter or exit from the market;
– this threshold and the relative non stationarity are
proposed to represent the key element in the selforganization mechanism. This self-organization, however, leads to an intermittency related to finite size
effects. For this reasons we define it as self-organized
intermittency.
Starting from the minimal model introduced in this paper and considering that one can obtain a detailed microscopic understanding of its dynamics, it is easy to identify
a number of realistic variants which can be introduced
as generalizations of the model. In future works we will
consider these changes. However, the present model was
aimed at a different target. The idea was to define the
minimal set of elements which could lead to the SF and
to the self-organization phenomenon.
