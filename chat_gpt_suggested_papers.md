Choosing a research question for your agent-based modeling (ABM) project in economics can be both exciting and challenging. The best questions often arise from identifying gaps in the current literature or from real-world economic phenomena that are not adequately explained by existing models. Here are some thought starters across various economic domains that might inspire a compelling research question for your project:

1. Environmental Economics
Question: How do individual behaviors and government policies impact the adoption of renewable energy sources in a regional economy?
ABM Application: Model households and firms making energy-related decisions based on economic incentives, social influence, and policy interventions.
2. Financial Markets
Question: How do information asymmetry and rumor spread influence stock market volatility?
ABM Application: Simulate a financial market where agents have varying access to information and observe how misinformation can lead to bubbles and crashes.
3. Urban and Regional Economics
Question: How does the distribution of amenities and jobs influence patterns of residential segregation and urban sprawl?
ABM Application: Create agents representing households with different preferences and constraints choosing where to live based on job locations, housing prices, and neighborhood characteristics.
4. Labor Economics
Question: What are the impacts of automation and artificial intelligence on employment patterns across different sectors?
ABM Application: Model a labor market where firms decide on the adoption of new technologies and workers have varying abilities to adapt or switch sectors.
5. Health Economics
Question: How do individual health behaviors and public health policies affect the spread of infectious diseases within communities?
ABM Application: Simulate the spread of a disease through a population where individuals’ movement and interaction patterns are influenced by personal health choices and government interventions.
6. Social Networks and Economic Decisions
Question: How do social networks influence consumer choices and the diffusion of new products in a market?
ABM Application: Model consumers making purchasing decisions influenced by their social connections, exploring how network structure affects market outcomes.
7. Game Theory and Strategic Interaction
Question: How do cooperative behaviors emerge in competitive economic environments, and what are their long-term effects on market efficiency?
ABM Application: Use ABM to simulate strategic interactions among agents in various game-theoretic settings, exploring the conditions under which cooperation is beneficial.
Selecting Your Question
When selecting your research question, consider:

Relevance: Is the question addressing a significant problem or gap in the literature?
Feasibility: Can the question be effectively explored using ABM within your project’s constraints?
Interest: Does the question spark your curiosity and passion, and does it align with your and Dylan's expertise and interests?
Next Steps
Once you've brainstormed potential questions, review the current literature to refine your question and ensure it adds value to the existing body of research. Collaboratively discussing these options can help you pinpoint a question that is both exciting and viable for your project.

> The approach provides a rst step towards modelling contagion risk when true linkages are unknown. It would be useful to extend the simulation analysis by relaxing the assumption that the defaulting bank is randomly selected and, along the lines of Albert et al (2000), considering the implications of targeted failure affecting big or highly connected interbank borrowers. This would be particularly interesting in a set-up in which the joint degree distribution was calibrated to match observed data. Added realism could also be incorporated into the model by using real balance sheets for each bank or endogenising the formation of the network. Extending the model in this direction could help guide the empirical modelling of contagion risk and is left for future work.

> Our starting point has been a detailed analysis of the LM
model first in terms of the role played by the total number
of players N and also on the study of the stability of the
SF with respect to the variation of the other parameters.
A particular puzzling point was the fact that the SF are
present only for a finite value of N (N = 500) in the LM
model and not in the asymptotic limit N → ∞. Starting from this consideration our aim has been to introduce
a minimal ABM based on fundamentalists and chartists
which would permit to clarify these points and eventually also to discuss the self-organization. A basic technical
simplification is the description of the chartists in terms of
the newly introduced effective potential model. This and
other similar simplifications permit us to analyze in detail the mathematical properties of the model. In order
to achieve the deepest understanding of the dynamics we
have focused for the moment on the linear returns. In paper II [13], we are going to consider also the extension to
logarithmic returns but in the limit of small fluctuations
the two approach essentially coincide. The main results of
our model are:
– detailed understanding of the origin of the SF with
respect to the microscopic dynamics of the agents;
– demonstration that in this class of model the SF correspond to finite size effects and not to universal critical
exponents. This finite size effect, however, can be active at different time scales;
bubbles of chartists can be triggered spontaneously
by a multiplicative cascade which can originate from
tiny random fluctuations. This situation resembles in
part the avalanches of the sandpile model in statistical
physics [32];
– we have shown the importance of the non stationarity in the dynamics of the number of active agents N
and we introduced a characteristic threshold to decide
when an agent can enter or exit from the market;
– this threshold and the relative non stationarity are
proposed to represent the key element in the selforganization mechanism. This self-organization, however, leads to an intermittency related to finite size
effects. For this reasons we define it as self-organized
intermittency.
Starting from the minimal model introduced in this paper and considering that one can obtain a detailed microscopic understanding of its dynamics, it is easy to identify
a number of realistic variants which can be introduced
as generalizations of the model. In future works we will
consider these changes. However, the present model was
aimed at a different target. The idea was to define the
minimal set of elements which could lead to the SF and
to the self-organization phenomenon.
