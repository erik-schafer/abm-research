# Next Steps for Agent Based Modeling Project

This document outlines the immediate next steps for our agent-based modeling project, categorized into relevant sections for clarity and ease of tracking.

## Project Setup

- [ ] **Tool and Environment Setup**
  - [ ] Ensure Git setup and alignment on collaboration tools
- [ ] **Initial Meeting:** Schedule and conduct an initial meeting to align on project goals, roles, and timelines.
  - [ ] Establish regular meetings and some channel for communication (gmail, slack, signal, etc)
  - [ ] Identify + Plan for work bandwidth (co-working days/times, hrs per week, to the extent possible)
  - [ ] Identify and assign next tasks
- [ ] **Trello Board Configuration:**
  - [ ] Create labels for task categorization
  - [ ] Create initial epics

## Ideation and Literature Review

- [ ] **Define Research Question**
  - [ ] Consider relevant literature.
  - [ ] Brainstorm potential questions.
  - [ ] Narrow down to a specific, researchable question.

- [ ] **Literature Review:**
  - [ ] Align on a system to organize works cited, important references, and findings; implement it.
  - [ ] Conduct literature review
    - [ ] Create epics and tasks in trello
    - [ ] Assign and execute tasks
  - [ ] Summarize findings
    - [ ] Draft an `summary.md` to jump summarize findings and provide resources for future *Introduction*, *Discussion*, *Conclusion* sections.

- [ ] **Prototype models**
  - [ ] Identify literature findings to reproduce
  - [ ] Identify toy models to develop as practice
  - [ ] Implement the models
  - [ ] Discuss findings / implications

- [ ] **Finalize Research Question:**
  - [ ] Review previous research question
    - [ ] Consider the literature review and prototypes
    - [ ] Validate or update the question
  - [ ] Align on and fix the final research question
  - [ ] Create a development plan
  - [ ] Create a writing plan

## Development

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Keep a detailed `methods.md` and `project_log.md` to track important decisions, milestones, and jump-start a methods section
  - [ ] Create epics and tasks in trello
- [ ] **Prototype Model**
- [ ] **Model Iteration**
- [ ] **Finalize Model and Results**
  - [ ] Validate model results against expectations and literature findings.
  - [ ] Create initial visualizations and data outputs
  - [ ] Produce a `results.md` to jump start results section

## Paper-Writing and Publication

- [ ] **Publication Target**
  - [ ] Research and compile a list of suitable journals
  - [ ] Pick primary and secondary targets
  - [ ] Align on writing tools
  - [ ] Review the submission guidelines and implement them

- [ ] **Outline Creation**
  - [ ] Draft an outline of the paper using tools and submission guidelines

- [ ] **Writing Plan**
  - [ ] Create epics and tasks in trello
  - [ ] Assign sections based on expertise and interest.
  - [ ] Integrate results and visualizations
  - [ ] Schedule regular review meetings
  
- [ ] **Draft Writing**
  - [ ] Begin drafting sections of the paper, adhering to the chosen publication's guidelines.
  - [ ] Leverage earlier markdown files to jump start drafts
  
- [ ] **Finalization and Submission**
  - [ ] Finalize drafts and review
  - [ ] Validate submission guidelines
  - [ ] Submit to the chosen publication

- [ ] **Post-Submission**
  - [ ] Track submission status and respond to any reviewer comments or requests.
